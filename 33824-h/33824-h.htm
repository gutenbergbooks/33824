<h2>POST-PRANDIAL WIT</h2>

<p>There is a sense, of course, in which everything from the pages of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Punch</span> might be regarded as coming into a collection entitled "After
Dinner Stories." All good stories are really for telling after dinner.
Somehow or other one seldom associates wit and humour with the breakfast
table, although the celebrated breakfast parties of Rogers, the banker,
were doubtless in no way deficient in either. Over the walnuts and wine,
when men have feasted well and are feeling on the best of terms with
themselves and their fellows, the cares of the day put past and the
pleasures of the gas-lit hours begun, that is undoubtedly the ideal time
for the flow of wit.</p>

<p>It must not, therefore, be thought that the present volume is in anywise
distinguished from the others of the series to which it belongs in the
appropriateness of its contents for the dinner party. No more than any
of its companions is it designed to that end; but as it is concerned
almost exclusively with the humours of dining, with stories of diners,
it will be admitted that its title is not without justification. Private
dinner parties, public banquets, the solitary dinner at the restaurant,
the giving and accepting of invitations, these and many other phases of
dining come within its scope, and if it be noticed that a considerable
amount of its humour has something of the fragrance of good old port&mdash;to
say nothing of the aroma of wines that are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> bad!&mdash;it can only be
retorted that <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's</span> duty has ever been to mirror the manners of
the changing time, and in his early days the wine flowed more freely
than it does to-day. For our personal taste we could have wished less of
this humour of the bottle, but throughout this library an effort has
been made to maintain in some degree a historical perspective, so that,
in addition to the prime purpose of entertainment, each of these books
in <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's Library</span> might be a faithful picture of the manners of the
Victorian period in which most of his life has been passed. If to-day
these manners seem to us just a trifle coarser than we esteem the social
habits of our own day, surely that is a comforting reflection and one
not lightly to be lost!</p>

<h2>A LITTLE DINNER OF THE FUTURE</h2>

<center><i>A Forecast by Mr. Punch's Own Clairvoyant</i></center>

<blockquote><p>According to the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, "an American professor is
looking forward to the time when cooking and dining shall become
lost arts, and we shall take our sustenance in the form of tablets
of concentrated things." Our esteemed contemporary appears to think
that such a system would necessarily do away with all conviviality
and social intercourse; but, unless <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's</span> clairvoyant is
liable to error (which is absurd), we need not take quite so gloomy
a view of the future. People will still entertain, only the dinner
of the next century will be a more economical and less tedious
function, and, instead of having to go through a trying interview
with her cook, the coming hostess will merely look in at the nearest
food chemist's, when some such conversation as the following will
settle the whole business.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> We've some people coming in to take a few tablets with us
this evening; what do you think I'd better have?</p>

<p><i>The Food Chemist.</i> You will require <i>soup</i>, of course, madam. I could
send you one of these patent soup-sprinklers, exceedingly simple to
work, and quite the fashion in the highest circles: the butler sprays
each guest before showing them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> upstairs. We supply the machine, charged
with the very best soup, at ninepence a night.</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> No, I don't want anything <i>fussy</i>, it's quite an informal
little gathering. An ounce of those mock-turtle jujubes at fourpence I
had last time will do very well.</p>

<p><i>The F. C.</i> Very good, madam. Then, with regard to fish? I can strongly
recommend these bi-carbonate of cod and oyster sauce lozenges, or I have
some sulphate of salmon and cucumber pastilles, that I think you would
like, ninepence the quarter-of-a-pound.</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> I'm afraid I mustn't be extravagant. I'll take a small bottle
of condensed smelt tabloids (the <i>sixpenny</i> size), and what are left
will come in nicely for the children's dinner next day.</p>

<p><i>The F. C.</i> Precisely so, madam. And as to <i>entr&eacute;es</i>&mdash;will you have
cockscomb cachous or sweetbread pilules?</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> It makes such a <i>long</i> dinner. I don't want a lot of things.</p>

<p><i>The F. C.</i> In <i>that</i> case, madam, I think I have the very article&mdash;a
most elegant electro-chemical preparation, combining <i>entr&eacute;e</i>, joint,
and bird, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> just a trace of vegetable matter, put up in small
capsules, at one and elevenpence halfpenny the box of one dozen.</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> That would be cheaper than having each course in separate
tablets, <i>wouldn't</i> it? I think I'll try a box. What wonderful
improvements they bring out nowadays, to be sure!</p>

<p><i>The F. C.</i> They do indeed, madam. I am told that the Concentrated Food
Stores will shortly be able to place on the market a series of graduated
wafers, each containing a complete dinner, from a City banquet to a
cutlet, at prices to correspond with the number of courses required.</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> Delightful! And then the most expensive dinners will be all
over in a minute, instead of dragging on to ten minutes or a quarter of
an hour, as I've known them to do sometimes! I've often thought what a
pity it is that we waste so much precious time as we do in merely
supplying our bodily wants.</p>

<p><i>The F. C.</i> We are improving, madam, slowly improving. And what about
sweets, cheese, and savouries?</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> I might have one of those two-inch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> blocks of condensed
apple-tart, and a box of cheese pills&mdash;<i>no</i> savouries. You see, it's
only a <i>family</i> party!</p>

<p><i>The F. C.</i> Exactly so, madam. And shall you be needing anything in the
way of stimulants?</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> Let me see&mdash;you may send me in a couple of ounces of
acidulated champagne drops&mdash;the <i>Australian</i> quality, <i>not</i> the French,
they're twopence an ounce dearer, and so few people notice the
difference nowadays, do they?</p>

<p><i>The F. C.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Not until the next morning! (<i>Aloud.</i>) And
liqueurs? Any brandy-balls with the coffee creams? We have some very
fine essence-of-dessert jellies&mdash;&mdash;. <i>Hostess</i> Nothing more, thank you.
(<i>To herself as she departs.</i>) I'm sure I've spent quite enough as it is
on John's stingy old relations, who never ask us to have so much as a
lunch-lozenge or a tea-tabloid with them!</p>

<h2>DINNER PLATITUDES</h2>

<p>Twice of soup is vulgar, but three times of soup implies that you must
be more than double-plated with vulgarity. Such a thing was never known,
not even at the Trinity Board, and turtle is not the slightest excuse
for your pushing things to such a vulgar length. An alderman would
really blush for you.</p>

<p>A soft answer turneth away wrath, and an invitation to take a glass of
wine will frequently restore warmth between two friends where only
coldness existed before.</p>

<p>No matter how plain your cook may be, so long as your dinner is
well-dressed.</p>

<p>A few compliments go a great way. A little savoury <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i> is quite
enough. Try too many, and you'll find they'll prove heavy.</p>

<p>When the ladies retire from the dinner-table, it is not usual for you
(supposing you to be a gentleman) to retire with them. In this instance,
the same law extends to the mistress as to the servants:&mdash;"No Followers
Allowed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>A gratuity well bestowed frequently has a happy effect. The servant that
is fee'd well takes care that his master does the same.</p>

<p>In the hands of an inferior <i>artiste</i>, whether an omelette turns out
good or bad, is quite a matter of toss up. It is the same with a
pancake.</p>

<p>Keep ill-natured people from your table, as you would sour fruit. They
are sure to disagree with every one. Avoid crab-apples, lest the apple
of discord should turn up amongst them.</p>

<h2>DINNERS AND DINERS</h2>

<center>(<i>With apologies to the P-ll M-ll G-z-tte</i>)</center>

<p>It had been my good fortune to give to Mademoiselle Faustine, a charming
little actress, a tip for the Welter Plate last spring. What more
natural than that I should ask her to give me a dinner as some slight
return? She readily accepted, and asked me to name the day. Glancing at
the sixth volume of my engagement book, I found my first vacant date was
June 18, '97. This was fortunate, as it is hardly possible&mdash;except at
Voisin's&mdash;to get a decent dinner unless you order it a year in advance.</p>

<p>"Where shall we dine?" asked Faustine.</p>

<p>"There is only one place where people <i>do</i> dine," I answered, a little
reproachfully. "The Bon March&eacute;. I will order the dinner."</p>

<p>So the place and the date were fixed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 30px;">
<img src="images/i_leaf.png" width="100%" alt="leaf symbol" />
</div><br />

<p>As Faustine was a quarter of an hour late&mdash;I had not seen her since our
arrangement&mdash;I waited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> in the alabaster portico of the Bon March&eacute;,
chatting amiably to the courteous commissionaire, an old comrade of mine
in the Wimbledon days. Jules, the courteous <i>chef</i>, was <i>au d&eacute;sespoir</i>.
Why had I not given him more notice? Madame was fifteen minutes late. If
he had only known! In a year and fifteen minutes it is possible to cook
a dinner. In a year&mdash;no. I tried to calm the worthy fellow&mdash;an old ally
of mine in the Crimean war. In vain; he complained the sardines were
spoiling. So I went into the dining-room, nodding courteously to eight
princes of the blood, neither of whom appeared, for the moment, to
recognise me.</p>

<p>As I seated myself, the entire staff, headed by a brass band, brought me
my <i>sardines &agrave; l'huile</i>. These are a <i>specialit&eacute;</i> of the house, and are
never&mdash;should never be, at least&mdash;eaten with the tin. The <i>potage &agrave; la
potasse</i> was quite excellent. I congratulated the courteous <i>chef</i>,
pointing out to him the desirability of mixing, sometimes, a little
anti-pyrine into the potassium&mdash;both drugs far too rarely used in modern
cookery. Then came the question of wine. This I solved for the moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
by ordering two Jeroboams of Stereoscopic Company et Fils; a <i>cuv&eacute;e</i> of
'80, absolutely <i>reserv&eacute;e</i> for my own use. As I had engaged the entire
staff of waiters, a crown prince, who was entertaining one of our
leading bicyclists, rose to leave, with his guest. I smiled and nodded
to them as they passed, which appeared to hasten their departure.</p>

<p>The <i>moulin &agrave; vent</i> was delicious, but the <i>dindon d&eacute;cousu</i> I could not
pass. No self-respecting <i>gourmet</i> will pass everything at a dinner.</p>

<p>Gontran, the kindly <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, was almost in tears, but I
consoled him by observing that the ostriches were cooked to a turn, and
the <i>bombe glac&eacute;e &agrave; l'anarchiste</i> faultless.</p>

<p>But my hostess? Where was she? Where was Mademoiselle Faustine? I had
quite forgotten her! I beckoned to Hagenbock, the press representative
of the restaurant, who informed me she had been dead eight months! I,
who read nothing but menus, had omitted to notice this in the papers. I
was greatly pained. The shock unnerved me&mdash;I could eat no more. Besides,
who was now to pay the bill?</p>

<p>I reproduce the bill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Couverts, &pound;5. Diners, &pound;36 8<i>s.</i> Pain, 2<i>s.</i> Champagne, &pound;47. Liqueurs,
15<i>s.</i> Addition, 3<i>s.</i></p>

<p>In all, &pound;89 8<i>s.</i>&mdash;(This is one of the few restaurants where a charge is
made for the addition.)</p>

<p>"Make out the bill," said I, "in francs, and send it to the executors of
Mademoiselle Faustine."</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Monsieur Victor de Train-de-Luxe is in many respects a delightful
person. In other ways he is not. For instance, because he was,
accidentally, the cause of my backing a winner at Ascot (simply by means
of ordinary stable information), he had the bad taste to suggest that I
should stand him a dinner.</p>

<p>I said, "Certainly, my dear Comte" (Comte being the courtesy title I
invariably give to foreigners from whom I have the hope of borrowing
money).</p>

<p>"Where shall it be?"</p>

<p>"There is only one place where one <i>can</i> dine," I said.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;the Bon March&eacute;," he replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," I answered. "No, <i>mon ami</i>. If you wish to eat a really
characteristic English dinner, come to the Vegetarian Restaurant in
Edgware Road. Come along. Come, <i>now</i>!"</p>

<p>"But it's only six o'clock. I am not hungry."</p>

<p>"All the better," I replied. And I also pointed out to him that the best
way to see London is outside an omnibus. So we started.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 30px;">
<img src="images/i_leaf.png" width="100%" alt="leaf symbol" />
</div><br />

<p>Arrived at the restaurant, I was enthusiastically received by the
courteous cashier, who presented me with a previous bill, which, I
noticed, had not been receipted. I said I thought it rather rude to
present a gentleman with a bill which they hadn't taken the trouble to
receipt.</p>

<p>We sat down.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," I said to Victor, "that I didn't know this dinner was coming
off to-day. If I had had notice, I might have ordered it beforehand; and
a dinner, to be perfection, should be eaten, if possible, on the day it
is cooked. At least, that's what I always think. I may be wrong."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsieur de Train-de-Luxe smiled, said I was a <i>farceur</i>, and I ordered
our dinner.</p>

<p>First, some turnip turtle soup, then, ortolans of spinach and mashed
potatoes, followed by a canvas-backed duck made of Indian corn, and
last, not least, plum-pudding. As all will agree, this makes a very
delicious and seasonable repast. Long dinners have quite gone out of
fashion. And this was washed down with a sparkling bottle of orange
champagne, '97.</p>

<p>My friend Victor, who is rather a <i>gourmet</i>, was so struck with the
first mouthful of soup, that he said it was quite enough, observing, he
had never tasted anything like it.</p>

<p>Pleased with this praise, I asked his opinion of the ortolans. He said
that their aroma dispensed with the necessity for their consumption. He
was evidently surprised.</p>

<p>When the bill was presented by the courteous "chucker-out," we found
that most unluckily neither of us had any money.</p>

<p>I append the bill.</p>

<p>Dinners (for two), 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> Champagne, 3<i>d.</i> Total, 2<i>s.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>To this I ought really to add:&mdash;</p>

<p>Cab (for three) to Marylebone Police Court, 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. (The constable
refused to walk without us.)</p>

<h2>THE DINNER CHAIRMAN'S VADE MECUM</h2>

<center>(<i>Compiled for the use of Orators during the Month of May Mouthings</i>)</center>

<p><i>Question.</i> You are accustomed to take the chair at a public dinner?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Yes. Or, to speak by the card, a dinner for the rest of the
company.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why, do you not partake of the good cheer before you with the rest
of your convives?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly not. I have to speak later on&mdash;a consideration which
entirely destroys my appetite.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there anything new to be said in the loyal toasts?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; and therefore it is better to return to the simplest form,
which is sure to be received with heartfelt enthusiasm.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>

<p><i>Q.</i> What can be said about the united service?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That it is absolutely delightful to expend millions in the
furtherance of their interests.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And can anything interesting be put in about the Houses of
Parliament?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not much. Sneers at the Lords are no longer popular, and the Lower
House is too respectable to be anything but a dull subject.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What about the toast of the evening?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That must be left to the secretary, who will furnish the chairman
with the necessary facts, which may be mixed with original remarks,
two-thirds humorous to one-third pathetic.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How are the visitors to be treated?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> With fulsome eulogy or comic depreciation inspired by the pages of
that excellent manual, <i>Who's Who</i>. Particular attention can be paid to
the entries under "Recreations" in that admirable work, for appropriate
chaff.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And in what terms does a chairman respond to the toast of his own
health?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> In a few muttered words addressed to an audience composed of a
gentleman fast asleep, the toast-master, and the waiters.</p>

<h2>THE ECONOMICS OF SMOKING</h2>

<h3>BY JOSEPH FUME.</h3>

<p>The man who smokes half his cigar, and puts the remainder by, knows
nothing about smoking.</p>

<p>The man who carries no cigar-case has no right to levy contributions on
those who do.</p>

<p>Never buy a cigar at a chemist's, they are sure to remind you of their
origin. I once knew a chemist, who also sold wine and cigars, and I am
sure he could only have had one workshop for his three businesses, and
that was his laboratory.</p>

<p>Mistrust the tobacco that is given in half-payment of a bill. Such
dealers may be clever in drawing a bill, but it is rarely that their
cigars are distinguished for being good "drawers."</p>

<p>The man who smokes with wine is quite capable of taking sugar with
oysters.</p>
